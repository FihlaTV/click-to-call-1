/**
 * visit() will walk through an AST using a depth first traversal, calling
 * the visitor's enter function at each node in the traversal, and calling the
 * leave function after visiting that node and all of its child nodes.
 *
 * By returning different values from the enter and leave functions, the
 * behavior of the visitor can be altered, including skipping over a sub-tree of
 * the AST (by returning false), editing the AST by returning a value or null
 * to remove the value, or to stop the whole traversal by returning BREAK.
 *
 * When using visit() to edit an AST, the original AST will not be modified, and
 * a new version of the AST with the changes applied will be returned from the
 * visit function.
 *
 *     const editedAST = visit(ast, {
 *       enter(node, key, parent, path, ancestors) {
 *         // @return
 *         //   undefined: no action
 *         //   false: skip visiting this node
 *         //   visitor.BREAK: stop visiting altogether
 *         //   null: delete this node
 *         //   any value: replace this node with the returned value
 *       },

 *         //   any value: replace this node with the returned value
 *       }
 *     });
 *
 * Alternatively to providing enter() and leave() functions, a visitor can
 * instead provide functions named the same as the kinds of AST nodes, or
 * enter/leave visitors at a named key, leading to four permutations of
 * visitor API:
 *
 * 1) Named visitors triggered when entering a node a specific kind.
 *
 *     visit(ast, {
 *       Kind(node) {
 *         // enter the "Kind" node
 *       }
 *     })
 *
 * 2) Named visitors that trigger upon entering and leaving a node of
 *    a specific kind.
 *
 *     visit(ast, {
 *       Kind: {
 *         enter(node) {
 *           // enter the "Kind" node
 *         }
 *         leave(node) {
 *           // leave the "Kind" node
 *         }
 *       }
 *     })
 *
 * 3) Generic visitors that trigger upon entering and leaving any node.
 *
 *     visit(ast, {
 *       enter(node) {
 *         // enter any node
 *       },
 *       leave(node) {
 *         // leave any node
 *       }
 *     })
 *
 * 4) Parallel visitors for entering and leaving nodes of a specific kind.
 *
 *     visit(ast, {
 *       enter: {
 *         Kind(node) {
 *           // enter the "Kind" node
 *         }
 *       },
 *       leave: {

/**
 * Creates a `lodash` object which wraps `value` to enable implicit method
 * chain sequences. Methods that operate on and return arrays, collections,
 * and functions can be chained together. Methods that retrieve a single value
 * or may return a primitive value will automatically end the chain sequence
 * and return the unwrapped value. Otherwise, the value must be unwrapped
 * with `_#value`.
 *
 * Explicit chain sequences, which must be unwrapped with `_#value`, may be
 * enabled using `_.chain`.
 *
 * The execution of chained methods is lazy, that is, it's deferred until
 * `_#value` is implicitly or explicitly called.
 *
 * Lazy evaluation allows several methods to support shortcut fusion.
 * Shortcut fusion is an optimization to merge iteratee calls; this avoids
 * the creation of intermediate arrays and can greatly reduce the number of
 * iteratee executions. Sections of a chain sequence qualify for shortcut
 * fusion if the section is applied to an array and iteratees accept only
 * one argument. The heuristic for whether a section qualifies for shortcut
 * fusion is subject to change.
 *
 * Chaining is supported in custom builds as long as the `_#value` method is
 * directly or indirectly included in the build.
 *
 * In addition to lodash methods, wrappers have `Array` and `String` methods.
 *
 * The wrapper `Array` methods are:
 * `concat`, `join`, `pop`, `push`, `shift`, `sort`, `splice`, and `unshift`
 *
 * The wrapper `String` methods are:
 * `replace` and `split`
 *
 * The wrapper methods that support shortcut fusion are:
 * `at`, `compact`, `drop`, `dropRight`, `dropWhile`, `filter`, `find`,
 * `findLast`, `head`, `initial`, `last`, `map`, `reject`, `reverse`, `slice`,
 * `tail`, `take`, `takeRight`, `takeRightWhile`, `takeWhile`, and `toArray`
 *
 * The chainable wrapper methods are:
 * `after`, `ary`, `assign`, `assignIn`, `assignInWith`, `assignWith`, `at`,
 * `before`, `bind`, `bindAll`, `bindKey`, `castArray`, `chain`, `chunk`,
 * `commit`, `compact`, `concat`, `conforms`, `constant`, `countBy`, `create`,
 * `curry`, `debounce`, `defaults`, `defaultsDeep`, `defer`, `delay`,
 * `difference`, `differenceBy`, `differenceWith`, `drop`, `dropRight`,

 * `flatMap`, `flatMapDeep`, `flatMapDepth`, `flatten`, `flattenDeep`,

   *
   *   type := array|bool|func|object|number|string|oneOf([...])|instanceOf(...)
   *   decl := ReactPropTypes.{type}(.isRequired)?
   *
   * Each and every declaration produces a function with the same signature. This
   * allows the creation of custom validation functions. For example:
   *
   *  var MyLink = React.createClass({
   *    propTypes: {
   *      // An optional string or URI prop named "href".
   *      href: function(props, propName, componentName) {
   *        var propValue = props[propName];
   *        if (propValue != null && typeof propValue !== 'string' &&
   *            !(propValue instanceof URI)) {
   *          return new Error(
   *            'Expected a string or an URI for ' + propName + ' in ' +
   *            componentName
   *          );
   *        }
   *      }
   *    },
   *    render: function() {...}
   *  });
